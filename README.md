    *   Best practices for storing API keys securely using Databricks secrets.
    *   **Hands-on:** Your first OpenAI API call from a Databricks notebook (e.g., simple text generation).

### [Notebook 2: Core Components of an AI Agent](Notebook%202_%20Core%20Components%20of%20an%20AI%20Agent.html)

*   **Module 2.1: Understanding the Agent Loop (Observe-Think-Act)**
    *   Detailed explanation of the Observe-Think-Act cycle as the fundamental operational flow of an agent.
    *   How agents perceive their environment (input/data), process information (reasoning/planning), and make decisions to act.
*   **Module 2.2: Prompt Engineering: The Art of Instructing Agents**
    *   Techniques for crafting effective prompts to guide agent behavior and elicit desired responses.
    *   Exploring different prompting strategies: role prompting, zero-shot, few-shot prompting.
    *   How to give agents a specific "persona," context, and clear instructions for their tasks.
    *   **Hands-on:** Experimenting with different prompt structures to control OpenAI model output.
*   **Module 2.3: Implementing Basic Memory for Agents**
    *   The importance of memory for context retention and coherent interaction in agents.
    *   Implementing simple short-term memory (e.g., storing and recalling recent conversation history).
    *   (Conceptual) Brief mention of challenges and approaches for long-term memory in more advanced agents.
    *   **Hands-on:** Building a simple conversational agent that remembers the last few turns of a dialogue.
*   **Module 2.4: Enabling Agents with Tools (Simple Implementations)**
    *   Introducing the concept of agents using "tools" (functions or external APIs) to interact with their environment or access information beyond their pre-trained knowledge.
    *   **Hands-on Example 1:** An agent that can use a "calculator" tool (a simple Python function) to perform arithmetic operations.
    *   **Hands-on Example 2 (Conceptual/Simplified):** An agent that can perform a web search (simulated using a predefined function that returns mock search results, or a very basic API call if simple enough for beginners).

### [Notebook 3: Building a Simple Agentic Application on Databricks](Notebook%203_%20Building%20a%20Simple%20Agentic%20Application%20on%20Databricks.html)

*   **Module 3.1: Defining Your Agent's Goal, Persona, and Capabilities**
    *   Choosing a simple, well-defined task for the agent (e.g., a Q&A bot over a small provided text document, a simple data summarizer, a basic task automator for a predefined workflow).
    *   Breaking down the chosen task into logical steps that the agent can perform using its LLM core and tools.
*   **Module 3.2: Implementing the Agent Logic with OpenAI**
    *   Using OpenAI models (e.g., GPT-3.5-turbo) as the core "thinking" or reasoning engine of the agent.
    *   Integrating prompts, memory (from Notebook 2), and tool-use capabilities to create the agent's operational flow.
    *   Step-by-step code walkthrough of the agent implementation in a Databricks notebook.
    *   **Hands-on:** Building the chosen simple agentic application.
*   **Module 3.3: Introduction to Basic RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation)**
    *   Explaining the concept: Enhancing agent responses by providing access to external knowledge bases.
    *   **Hands-on Example:**
        *   Loading a small text file (e.g., a short FAQ, a product description) into the Databricks environment.
        *   Implementing a very simple RAG pattern: when the agent needs to answer a question, it first retrieves relevant snippets from the document (e.g., using basic keyword matching or a simplified embedding search if feasible for beginners) and then uses OpenAI to generate an answer based on those snippets.
        *   (Optional, if time permits and complexity can be managed for beginners) Brief introduction to OpenAI embeddings for semantic search.
*   **Module 3.4: Testing, Evaluating, and Iterating on Your Agent**
    *   Strategies for testing your agent's responses and behavior for the defined task.
    *   Identifying and debugging common issues (e.g., incorrect responses, failure to use tools, poor contextual understanding).
    *   Tips for iteratively improving agent performance through prompt refinement, tool adjustments, or memory enhancements.

### [Notebook 4: Next Steps and Expanding Your Agentic AI Horizons](Notebook%204_%20Next%20Steps%20and%20Expanding%20Your%20Agentic%20AI%20Horizons.html)

        *   Potential for scaling agentic applications using Databricks compute resources (conceptual).
        *   Connecting agents to data stored in Delta Lake for more complex RAG or data-driven actions.
